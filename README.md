The entry point for the playbook is the file **site.yml**


Installation
------------------

* `git clone https://github.com/migdress/automated_deployment.git`
* `cd automated_deployment`
* On Linux, give execution permissions to `install.sh` with `chmod +x install.sh` and run it from a terminal
* On Windows, run `install.bat` from a command prompt
* Modify configuration files `aws-vpc/vars/main.yml` and `web/vars/main.yml`


Usage
------------------
* Once configuration is ready, for the first run make sure the `hosts` file
  does not contain any host, so that the playbook will populate it during
  execution

* Run with `ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml`
  
* If you want to specify an ec2 host, you need to add the line in `hosts` and
  place the private key file at `storage/private-keys`, also make sure the
  configuration at `aws-vpc/vars/main.yml` match the key name
